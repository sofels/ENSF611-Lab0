# Lab0 - numpy-pandas-matplotlib review

## Goal

The goal of this lab is to review the numpy-pandas-matplotlib/seaborn toolchain.

You will practice loading data from file, manipulating the data in pandas `DataFrame`, inspecting data in pandas `DataFrame` and visualizing data with pandas, matplotlib and seaborn libraries.

## What to do
1. Review:
- `lab0-numpy.ipynb`
- `lab0-pandas.ipynb`
- `lab0-visualization.ipynb`

2. Download the auto-mpg data set (`auto-mpg.data` and `auto-mpg.names`) from UCI: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Auto%2BMPG

3. Using auto-mpg, repeat steps performed on `heart-attack.csv` in:
- `lab0-pandas.ipynb`, save as `lab0-pandas-auto_mpg.ipynb`
- `lab0-visualization.ipynb`, save as `lab0-visualization-auto_mpg.ipynb`

Instead of `gender`, use `origin`. Instead of `age`, use `mpg`. Or other suitable variables of your choice.

4. (optional) Review lab0_chicken_prep.ipynb

5. Complete lab0_chicken.ipynb


## What to hand in
As described above, pandas and visualization notebooks adapted to the auto mpg dataset in two files:
- `lab0-pandas-auto_mpg.ipynb`
- `lab0-visualization-auto_mpg.ipynb`

Completed lab0_chicken.ipynb

Commit changes to git with **at least two (2)** student commits for each file
